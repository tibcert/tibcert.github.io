                    <p> The Tibetan Computer Emergency Readiness Team (TibCERT) seeks to create a formal, coalition-based structure for reducing and mitigating online threats in the Tibetan community, as well as to expand Tibetansâ€™ technical research capacity on threats in the diaspora and surveillance and censorship inside Tibet, ultimately ensuring greater online freedom and security for Tibetan society as a whole.
